# hello-world
Test - first repository
Hello fellow GoGitters, I'm Nilyria. I got into web dev and graphic design when I was 11 years old but fell out of it, 17 years later, here I am, back at it again, but for good this time. I'm starting from the ground zero, studying CS at WGU while taking in as many accessible resources I can find. Here's to being a fullstack dev in the making...I can't wait to look back at my first projects in a few years and cringe.
